This is an alternative to Troy's original 'Wide Logo' sticker, with a twist :)

I am very bad with colors so feel free to suggest better alternatives.
The first design uses the same color palette as the [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) website.
For the second one, I picked a color that I feel more fully relates the anguish one feels when learning they've been pwned.
