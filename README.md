# HIBP Stickers

Stickers are awesome - everyone loves stickers! For HIBP's 5th birthday I'm getting a bunch of them made and giving everyone else the artwork so they can have their own printed. You're welcome to take this artwork and use it with the likes of [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=1764621701&utm_medium=link&utm_source=invite) (that referral link will get you $10 off and give me $10 towards my next order) or anywhere else, for that matter. Check out the [blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-the-sticker/) for more details.

Do also feel free to submit your own to this repository. I welcome any other creative content that you think others might benefit from. Vector graphics are awesome, but submit a PNG too if you can so that everyone can see what it looks like.
